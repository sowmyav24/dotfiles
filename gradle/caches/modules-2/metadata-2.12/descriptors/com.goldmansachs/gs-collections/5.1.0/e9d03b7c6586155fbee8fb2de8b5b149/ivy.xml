    <description homepage="https://github.com/goldmansachs/gs-collections">GS Collections is a collections framework for Java. It has JDK-compatible List, Set and Map
        implementations with a rich API and set of utility classes that work with any JDK compatible Collections,
        Arrays, Maps or Strings. The iteration protocol was inspired by the Smalltalk collection framework.</description>
